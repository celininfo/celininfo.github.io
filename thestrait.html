”During the warmest summer on record in the region of Oresund, an array of strange events unfold; swimmers and kite surfers from the coastlines of Denmark and Sweden go missing whilst debris of personal belongings wash up on the shorelines, aided by dramatic tidal fluctuations. The ‘Lynnetteholmen Project’ – a large-scale expansion scheme of the city of Copenhagen involving several corporate partners is suspended and the artificial island promised to put an end to the housing crisis is postponed indefinitely. Amid rising tensions, a geological survey on the island located in the strait between Malmö and Copenhagen; Saltholmen, is published and contributes to blurring fact with fiction. The public is in turn confronted with apathetic politicians, absent investigations and disappearing evidence material. When an entire cargo ship goes missing, conspiracies of a supernatural force somewhere in the strait proliferate. Two independent investigators emerge to collect and navigate the locals’ stories. As they start to trace and map testimonies and events, everything seems to point towards a portal that has reopened after centuries of closure.” <br>

"The Strait" is a collaboration between Asta Lynge and Matilda Tjäder which was premiered at Delfi, Malmö (2020) and later shown in the midst of their exhibition at Bizarro, Copenhagen (2021). The film is part of Copenhagen Architecture Festival 2021 where it will be screened at Cinemateket followed by a panel discussion featuring the artists. The duo is currently working towards the three episodes following their pilot that will be premiered in the spring of 2022. <br>
<br>
Based on a concept or an allegory Asta Lynge (b. 1988) works associatively across materials and processes. She is interested in the notion of progress and its inherent affiliation with technology. Departing from a speculative space her work is informed by images and products manufactured for a ‘green’ consumer culture. Asta holds a BFA from Central Saints Martins (2012) and was part of the first iteration of the CSM Associate Studio Programme (2013 - 16). She has recently been showing works at dépendance (Brussels), Kunsthaus Glarus (Glarus) and Le Bourgeois (London). Upcoming exhibitions and screenings include: Cucina (Copenhagen) and Copenhagen Architecture Film Festival.<br>
<br>
Matilda Tjäder (1989 b. Malmö, Sweden) is an artist building fictional worlds via text, sound, performance and moving image. In her storytelling she likes to create experimental infrastructures where the familiar interfaces with the unknown, the individual with the collective, and memories with the absence of sentience. Recent presentations of her work include; Sweetwater, Berlin; Bizarro, Copenhagen; The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, Los Angeles; and Cell Project Space, London. Other projects include the album “Music for 1 Piano and 4 Hands” composed and performed with Alex Pierce and released on ArachHE (2020), the manuscript for "Putting The Garden To Sleep" with Olof Runsten shown at INKONST, Malmö and Skogen, Gothenburg (2021) and together with Emilia Thorin she curated the Pride Park performance program in Folkets Park, Malmö (2021). Her album of new compositions and fiction will be released with HTSU Cooperative during fall 2021. She sometimes makes music under the moniker fivestarrockstar.
