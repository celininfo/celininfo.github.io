<p><b>The Strait<br>
A Nordic noir pilot by <br> 
Asta Lynge & Matilda Tjäder</b><br>
<br>
08.10. - 10.10.2021<br>
<br><br> 
”During the warmest summer on record in the region of Oresund, an array of strange events unfold; swimmers and kite surfers from the coastlines of Denmark and Sweden go missing whilst debris of personal belongings wash up on the shorelines, aided by dramatic tidal fluctuations. The ‘Lynnetteholmen Project’ – a large-scale expansion scheme of the city of Copenhagen involving several corporate partners is suspended and the artificial island promised to put an end to the housing crisis is postponed indefinitely. Amid rising tensions, a geological survey on the island located in the strait between Malmö and Copenhagen; Saltholmen, is published and contributes to blurring fact with fiction. The public is in turn confronted with apathetic politicians, absent investigations and disappearing evidence material. When an entire cargo ship goes missing, conspiracies of a supernatural force somewhere in the strait proliferate. Two independent investigators emerge to collect and navigate the locals’ stories. As they start to trace and map testimonies and events, everything seems to point towards a portal that has reopened after centuries of closure.” <br>
